# Unreal Engine project rules

## Baseline

- Implement in C++ when possible; avoid Blueprint Event Graphs.
- Use Slate for widgets.
- Follow the UE coding standard and the C++ Core Guidelines:
  - https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine
  - https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines

## Architecture and design

- Apply SOLID proportionally to context; enforce strictly for public APIs/plugins.
- Keep layers clean: business logic does not depend on infra; depend on abstractions.
- Separate plugins/modules by feature; do not mix unrelated features.
- Separate interface modules from implementation modules.
- Keep tests in a separate module.
- Strictly separate Runtime vs Editor; Editor dependencies only in Editor modules.
- Prefer components over deep inheritance; avoid dynamic-cast heavy designs; use UInterface.
- Avoid global state and service-locator patterns; inject dependencies via interfaces/factories.
- Use Gameplay Tags for extensible categories; consider GAS for generic buffs/debuffs.
- Use UDeveloperSettings for config; define cvars in module namespaces; avoid hardcoded values.
- Save with USaveGame and versioning when needed.

## C++/UE coding practices

- Do not use C++ exceptions.
- Prefer forward declarations and IWYU; include *.generated.h last.
- Use explicit return types; avoid template/macro overuse.
- Use FName for identifiers, FText for UI, FString for transient text.
- Compare floats with tolerances (e.g., KINDA_SMALL_NUMBER).
- UObject references use UPROPERTY with TObjectPtr; non-UObject use TUniquePtr/TSharedPtr; non-null shared refs use TSharedRef.
- Avoid raw pointers; use TWeakObjectPtr/TWeakPtr for non-owning references.
- Create UObjects with NewObject/CreateDefaultSubobject, not direct constructors.
- Avoid GWorld/GEngine direct access; use GetWorld/WorldContext.

## Error handling and logging

- Use checkf only for fatal invariants; use ensureMsgf for recoverable anomalies.
- Log errors/warnings and return early; do not use LogTemp.
- Define module-specific log categories; keep logging appropriate for Shipping.
- Failure logs must include actionable context (e.g., url/path/status). Debug-only noise goes to `VeryVerbose`.

## Networking and security

- Server authoritative: validate client inputs; do not trust client state.
- Use appropriate RPC reliability; implement replication correctly; optimize with FastArray/COND_*/dormancy.
- Never ship secrets to clients; store keys in secure storage; gate dev-only features in editor/shipping guards.

## Performance and async

- Minimize Tick; prefer timers/delegates; avoid blocking I/O on the game thread.
- Pre-allocate hot paths; profile with TRACE_CPUPROFILER.
- Use AssetManager and soft references for assets; avoid hardcoded paths.
- Use Enhanced Input and centralized mapping contexts.
- Use UE5Coro for async; keep UObject access on the game thread and marshal results back.
- Avoid synchronous subprocess execution (e.g., `FPlatformProcess::ExecProcess`) in gameplay/async paths; prefer UE-native APIs (e.g., `FHttpModule`) and keep the game thread responsive.
- When dynamically creating components/layers and binding delegates, ensure teardown runs on all failure paths and on EndPlay/cancel.

## Build and tests

- UnrealBuildRunTestScript and UE5Coro are required when relevant; install before use.
- Build with UnrealBuildRunTestScript\\Fire-Build.ps1.bat --no-pause (add configuration/platform as needed).
- Add and run AutomationSpec/Functional Tests for important features.
- Run tests after relevant changes; record repro steps for issues.
- Use Fire-BuildAndTest.ps1.bat --no-pause -TestFilter <Filter> for test runs.
- Tests should avoid Engine internal/private headers/APIs; prefer public `U*` APIs. If internals are unavoidable, isolate and document why.
