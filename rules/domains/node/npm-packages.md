# Node package publishing

- For scoped npm packages, set publishConfig.access = "public".
- Set files to constrain the published contents.
- If a clean npm install is insufficient, use prepare (or equivalent) to build.

## Verification

- Use npm pack --dry-run to inspect the package contents.
- Run npm test when tests exist.
