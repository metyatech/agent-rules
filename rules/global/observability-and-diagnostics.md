# Observability and diagnostics

## General policy

- Design for debuggability: make failures diagnosable from logs/metrics/traces without reproducing locally.
- Add observability in the same change set as behavior changes that affect runtime behavior, performance, or reliability.

## Logging

- Prefer structured logs for services; keep field names stable (e.g., level, message, component, request_id/trace_id, version).
- Include actionable context in errors (what failed, which input/state, what to do next) without logging secrets/PII.
- Log at the right level; avoid noisy logs in hot paths.

## Metrics

- For long-running services, expose metrics for latency, error rate, throughput, and saturation; add domain metrics for critical flows.
- Treat missing metrics as a defect when they block verification or incident response.

## Tracing

- For multi-service or async flows, use OpenTelemetry and propagate context across boundaries (HTTP/gRPC/queues).
- Correlate logs and traces via trace_id/request_id.

## Health and self-checks

- Services must have readiness and liveness checks; fail fast when dependencies are unavailable.
- CLIs should provide a verbose mode and clear error output; add a self-check command when it reduces support burden.
