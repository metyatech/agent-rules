# Thread inbox

- `thread-inbox` is the persistent cross-session conversation context tracker. Use it to preserve discussion topics, decisions, and context that span sessions.
- If `thread-inbox` is not installed, install it via `npm install -g @metyatech/thread-inbox` before proceeding.
- Store `.threads.jsonl` in the workspace root directory (use `--dir <workspace-root>`). Do not commit it to version control.
- At session start, run `thread-inbox inbox` and `thread-inbox list --status waiting` to find threads needing attention; report findings before starting new work.
- Do not create threads for tasks already tracked by `task-tracker`; threads are for context and decisions, not work items.
- If a thread captures a persistent behavioral preference, encode it as a rule and resolve the thread.
- Detailed usage procedures (status model, when to create/add messages, lifecycle) are in the `manager` skill.
