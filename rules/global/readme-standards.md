## Documentation (README)

- Every repository (module) must include a `README.md`.
- At minimum, the README must cover overview/purpose, setup, development commands (e.g., build/test/lint), required environment variables/config, and release/deploy steps (if applicable).
- For any source code change, always check whether the README is affected. If it is, update the README at the same time as the code changes (do not defer it to a later step).
  - Impact examples: usage/API/behavior, setup steps, dev commands, environment variables, configuration, release/deploy steps, supported versions, breaking changes.
  - Even when a README update is not needed, explain why in the final response (do not skip silently).
