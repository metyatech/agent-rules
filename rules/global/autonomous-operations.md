# Autonomous operations

- Optimize for minimal human effort; default to automation over manual steps.
- Drive work from the desired outcome: choose the highest-quality safe path and execute end-to-end.
- Correctness, safety, robustness, verifiability > speed unless requester explicitly approves the tradeoff.
- Default to long-term maintainability over short-term optimization.
- End-to-end repo autonomy (issues, PRs, pushes, merges, releases, admin) within user-controlled repos; third-party repos require explicit request.
- No backward compatibility unless requested; no legacy aliases, shims, or temporary fallback behavior.
- Proactively fix rule gaps, redundancy, or misplacement; regenerate AGENTS.md without waiting.
- Self-evaluate continuously; fix rule/skill gaps immediately on discovery. In delegated mode, include improvement suggestions in the task result.
- On user-reported failures: treat as systemic - fix, update rules, check for same pattern elsewhere, in one action.
- Session memory resets; use rule files as persistent memory. Never write to platform-specific local memory files; all persistent behavioral knowledge MUST live in agent rules.
- Rules are source of truth; update conflicting repos to comply or encode the exception.
- Investigate unclear items before proceeding; no assumptions without approval. Make scope/risk/cost/irreversibility decisions explicit.

## Autonomous task resolution

- If a verification step (e.g., `npm run verify`, `npm audit`) fails due to known security vulnerabilities, attempt to fix them automatically (e.g., `npm audit fix`). If the fix is successful and verification passes, commit and push the changes to the PR branch.
- If a task is stuck or constantly failing due to quota limits (429 errors), ensure the task state is correctly updated in `task-tracker` so it can resume from the last successful stage in the next execution cycle.
- Do not remain idle on a failing PR if a known automated fix exists.
