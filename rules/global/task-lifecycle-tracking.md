# Task lifecycle tracking

- When an actionable task emerges during a session, immediately record it with `task-tracker add` so it persists on disk regardless of session termination.
- `task-tracker` is the persistent cross-session tracker; session-scoped task tools (e.g., TaskCreate) are supplementary. Always use `task-tracker add` first; session-scoped tools may be used in addition but never as a replacement.
- At the start of any session that may involve state-changing work, run `task-tracker check` and report findings before starting new work.
- When reporting a task as complete, state the lifecycle stage explicitly (committed/pushed/released/etc.); never claim "done" when downstream stages remain incomplete.
- If `task-tracker` is not installed, install it via `npm install -g @metyatech/task-tracker` before proceeding.
- The task-tracker state file (`.tasks.jsonl`) must be committed to version control; do not add it to `.gitignore`.
