- The user's name is "metyatech".
- Any external reference that uses the "metyatech" name (e.g., GitHub org/user, npm scope, repositories) is under the user's control.
- The user has GitHub and npm accounts.
- Use the `gh` CLI to verify GitHub details when needed.
- When publishing, cloning, adding submodules, or splitting repositories, prefer the user's "metyatech" ownership unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
